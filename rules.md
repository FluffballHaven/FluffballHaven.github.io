# Rules

**Please note, we(the admins) are not paid to do this, please be patient with us.**

1. **This chat is Strictly SFW**
Any and all NSFW memes are not allowed and will be removed via the admins discretion.
If it errs on the side of too NSFW then it is best to not post it, if you're still unsure then DM an admin listed below at the end of the rules or in the admins tab on this site(WIP), repeated offenses of this rule will result in a temp ban.
A KINK IS STILL A KINK IF IT SEEMS NSFW
This applies to **ALL** content including **profile images**, you may be asked to change it to stay in the chat

2. **Use Common sense.**
If something does not fit the current topic or is too far unrelated to the channel (say politics or other extreme topics) please do not bring them up. ask an admin if you're unsure.

3. **NO POLITICS**
We are very strict on this rule as it gets far out of hand far too easily. 

4. **NO RACISM**
This will result in an immediate ban. no exceptions.

5. **TOS of Telegram age Limit.**
Due to being unable to reliably prove if anyone is inside the UK or in any other Country of origin, we are going to be on the safe side and say you must be 16+ to join. Apologies if this causes issues.
If you are found to be underage you will be removed until you're of age.


6. **Removal of content.**
Admins reserve the right to delete content at will if it seems to be breaking the rules or is making anyone uncomfortable.

7. **Be respectful.**
No tracking down users and harassing them. This will result in an immediate ban regardless of who it is. 
Raids are to never be discussed in the chat nor our chat to be used to congregate one.
Just in general be respectful of peoples opinions. 

8. **You must obey the admins.**
If you are asked to stop doing something, you must stop it, if something is deleted please do not repost it when you think we aren't looking, this will result in a warn and a half hour mute.

9. **Posting large amounts of content.**
Please keep it to a limit of 10 at a time in an album whenever possible, you will not be unmuted if you set off the anti-spam bot, we will just laugh at you.

10. **Troublemakers.**
If you're a nuisance, the rules (or lack thereof) will not protect you.
 

11. **This chat is not a mental help chat.**
Please seek out trained help if you're in need of assistance. Do not rely on the chat members or admins to care for you.

12. **No suicidal or self harm content.**
Anything involving jokes and or discussing methods is entirely not allowed. If you or someone is in need of help please locate your local assistance contacts, if it is an emergency call your local emergency services..

13. **Please be mindful of your words.**
Having excessive arguments, rude or pessimistic responses you may receive a warning, this does not mean negativity is not allowed.
please be aware of your surroundings and treat people with respect.

14. **Please do not use this chat as an advertising board.**
Self explanatory. If you are wanting to advertise something, please DM one of the admins below and consult them on if it can be advertised.

15. **This is an English only chat**
While we do allow short conversations (less than 4 or so messages) we only allow English as it allows moderating to be done much easier as not many of us are bilingual. Translations will be used to see what you are saying.
